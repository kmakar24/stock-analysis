# Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose and Background 
We are taking our original code, which allowed Steve to analyze DQ stock along with Green Energy stocks and refactoring it. The purpose of doing this is so that Steve can be able to analyze any stock he wants more efficiently. 

## Results 

The overall 2017 stock performance was a lot better than the 2018 stock performance. As seen in the two images below:

## Summary
