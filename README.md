ANALYSIS 

# Stock Analysis 

## Overview of Project 

### Purpose and Background 
We are taking our original code, which allowed Steve to analyze DQ stock along with Green Energy stocks and refactoring it. The purpose of doing this is so that Steve can be able to analyze any stock he wants more efficiently. 

## Results 

The overall 2017 stock performance was a lot better than the 2018 stock performance. As seen in the two images below: 

### 2017

### 2018

Also there was a huge difference in the speed in which the Original code ran and the Refactoring code ran. Please see below:

### Refactored codes for 2017 and 2018 and how fast they ran

As you can tell from the above images there is a big difference in how much faster the refactored code runs.

## Summary 

### Advantages of Refactoring Code 

Refactored codes allows you to handle much larger data sets a lot quicker of a speed. It is way more efficient because you are improving your original code. It is a positive for someone who uses the code but has some downfalls for the person refractoring the code. 

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code 

There is more room for error when you refactor a code. You really have to pay attention and know what you had in the original code in order for you to be able to improve it and make it run correctly. You need to put more thought into it and it can be more time consuming because you spend a lot of time improving the code. You have to be very organized when refactoring the code so if someone else is to see your code they know what you were doing.
